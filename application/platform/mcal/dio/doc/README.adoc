# dio Design Notes

## Targets

* Provide a simple interface to configure and access GPIOs without knowing the concrete registers
* Abstract just the STM32 device and provide its capabilities
* Efficient access to ports

## Notes

* Hide concrete registers for the user
* Different derivatives of the same MCU have a different set of GPIO ports and pins
