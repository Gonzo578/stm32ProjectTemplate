# CMake Build System for STM32 Microcontrollers

This project has the goal to build up a toolchain to build software for STM32 microcontrollers
running under Linux (Ubuntu18.04 in my case) using the CMake build system generator and docker.

Goals:

* Encapsulate the build toolchain (compiler, cmake, ...) within a docker container https://github.com/Gonzo578/docker-toolchain [toolchain]
* Build docker images in a way that single major tools can be easily exchanged without creating big images.
* Create the build system by using CMake

# General Idea
Why does building SW for a microcontroller look so much different compared to building software for a linux system?
Therefore, the general idea is to build a toolchain that is easily maintainable and capable to run builds for a linux
native system and the target system without doing something different. The native build will then be used to 
run e.g. unit tests of the different software modules and the target build is clearly used to run the "real" SW
on the target system to have fun.
Genrally CMake is prepared for cross compiling by providing it a toolchain file where CMake gets all the target specfic
stuff out. Instead the approach here is to build a docker container which is designed in a way where CMake can automatically
detect by itself the target environment. That means the docker container comes only with the appropriate toolchain
used to build either native or target (Cortex M). All pathes are configured within the container to look like on
any other Linux distribution.
In order to provide the general build configuration (all compiler/linker settings) that affect the ABI the idea is
to ship the container with a conan profile that provides these settings. By this means, the idea is to get rid of the
toolchain file at all. So the build always looks like a native build and one only needs to replace the docker container
where the build is run inside.
This has the further addvantage, that also on the embedded MCU the precompiled libraries can be used as packages without
re-compiling and further ensuring binary compatibility.

## To Be Continued

Step by step integrate further tools

* Support unit testing by using gtest (on host system) with a separate docker container including the host toolchain
* Package management using conan (https://conan.io/)
* Code documentation using doxygen (http://www.doxygen.nl/)
* Developer documentation
* Code style checks clang-format (https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html)
* [done] Static code analysis clang-tidy (https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)

## Using the Docker Toolchain to Build your SW

In order to build your sowtware using docker, move to your project root directory and start the docker container as follows:

 docker run -it -v $(pwd):$(pwd) gonzo578/gcc-arm-embedded-2019q3:V0.0.1 /bin/bash

This starts a docker contrainer including the gcc-arm-embeedded-2019q3 toolchain. The projects root
directory is mapped to the same directory inside the container. This is required because currently the
pathes inside of the build results are absolute. In order to debug the application outside of the
container, the pathes need to be the same (else, the debugger would not find the source files). The other
solution can be to manually configure the source file locations for the debugger.
For convenience a script is provided with the project to start the docker container:

 ./run-docker.sh 

## Running your Build

In order to build the software inside the container conduct the following steps:

* Change to the project root folder (same as outside of the container)
* Create a build folder (´mkdir build´) => use out of source builds! (Note: the CMakeLists.txt is configured to generte an error if
	you try to build directly in the source tree)
* Change to the build folder (´cd build´)
* run the following command

 cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/cm4.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..

Or just call the build-target.sh script which does the same thing for you incl. the final build command.

This runs cmake with the proper CMake toolchain file (location: ´/cmake/cm4.cmake´) and with
build type ´debug´ in order to include debugging outputs in the build results.


NOTE: In future more basic toolchain files will be added instead of cm4.cmake.

### Using clang-tidy

Running static code analysis can be achieved by using the following command:

 cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug "-DCMAKE_CXX_CLANG_TIDY=/usr/bin/clang-tidy;-checks=google-*,cppcoreguidelines-*" ..

This includes clang-tidy during the build with checks related to:

* Google coding guidelines ( https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html )
* C++ core guidelines ( https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines )

Precodition is that you use a docker image that includes clang-tidy in its base image (toolchain image starting from V0.1.0).

## Test Environment

The toolchain has been checked by using a STM3F4Disco board. (https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f4discovery.html).
Debugging is done with the STM32 System Workbench (https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html)
